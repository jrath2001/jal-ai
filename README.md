What is the idea behind Jal.AI ?

Based on the UN Sustainable Development Goal No 6, We have designed a Machine Learning/AI based system that helps to calculate and predict the purity of water samples. It also recommends strategies for water purification and quality improvement. 

Why is Jal.AI unique and how can it help to solve water problems ?

A lot has been said & done on “access to pure & potable water” yet the world struggles to find an apt solution. Jal.AI is an intelligent and easy-to-implement approach. It can accurately help to know what is the purity status of a water sample and also recommend strategies. Without running to a lab for testing and then finding out methods of purification, one can get to know in seconds by saving time and money. The model can keep improving as more and more data and strategies are provided. 

To know how Jal.AI works and how we built it and what's more ahead, please check the PPT.
